Its learning capacity is limited, as it cannot model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. With only a single decision boundary, it can separate data with a straight line (or hyperplane) but cannot handle more intricate patterns. It also struggles to capture interactions between features, and adding more inputs does not increase its ability to solve non-linear problems.\n",

Hidden layers allow the network to learn non-linear relationships and combine multiple decision boundaries to handle complex patterns. MLPs have greater flexibility and capacity, enabling them to approximate almost any function and capture interactions between features through hidden neurons. This makes them much more effective for real-world problems like image recognition, speech processing, and natural language tasks."
